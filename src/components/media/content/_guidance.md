## Usage

Use media to add an image or video that supports and reinforces the content. Ensure media used is relevant and impactful. 

### Images

Find out more about [images and alt text](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/digital-service-toolkit/resources/content-writing/content-101/images-and-alt-text) in our guides.

### Videos

Find out more about [video and audio](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/digital-service-toolkit/resources/content-writing/content-101/documents-and-media/video-and-audio) in our guides.

### Captions
Captions by default contain a coloured background to visually connect the text to the image or video. If your caption text would be better placed without a background, this option is also available.

### Floating classes
Use floating classes to align your media within content to give it the relevant prominence and alignment.

These include:

- 100% - aligned centre
- 90% - aligned centre
- 80% - aligned centre
- 70% - aligned centre 
- 60% - aligned centre
- 50% - aligned left or right

## Usage

Use media to add an [image](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/digital-service-toolkit/resources/content-writing/content-101/images-and-alt-text) or [video](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/digital-service-toolkit/resources/content-writing/content-101/documents-and-media/video-and-audio) that supports and reinforces the content. Ensure media used is relevant and impactful. 

Each media component needs to be allocated a **width** and **position**. We recommend using width percentages in increments of ten at the positions below: 

- Widths of 30%, 40% and 50% should have a position of **left** or **right**.

- Widths of 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100% should have a position of **centre**

### Captions
Captions by default contain a coloured background to visually connect the text to the image or video. If your caption text would be better placed without a background, this option is also available.
